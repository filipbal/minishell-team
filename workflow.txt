Git Branching Strategy:

main branch: Contains stable, working code
dev branch: Development branch for integration
Feature branches:

feature/parser
feature/executor
feature/builtins
feature/signals
etc.



Workflow:

Create feature branches from dev
Work on features independently
Make regular commits with clear messages
Create pull requests to merge into dev
Test thoroughly on dev
Merge stable features into main
